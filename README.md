# 📊 Waggle Corp. – Lapcat vs Lapdog Power BI Analysis Project

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project was developed for **Waggle Corp.**, a startup that creates smart devices for pets.  
The goal was to compare **two products**:  
- **Lapdog** 🐶 → A fitness collar for dogs, already successful in the market.  
- **Lapcat** 🐱 → A prototype collar for cats, currently being tested.  

Our task was to build an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to analyze and compare product performance, user satisfaction, and demographic data.  
The results help the **CEO decide** whether **Lapcat** should be launched to the market.
